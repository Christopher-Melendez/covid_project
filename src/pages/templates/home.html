<h3>Project Aim:</h3>
<p id="project-aim"> 
    The COVID-19 Pandemic while grueling for all, did not affect all communities equally. Certain regions of New York experienced the effects of 
    COVID-19 worse than others. This project aims to first provide a visualization for both Covid Cases and Deaths, as well as other factors by 
    geographical region. You can then use these visualizations to make your own conclusions about the correlations between certain factors and 
    COVID-19 disparity in New York.

<h3>Project Flow:</h3>
<p id="project-flow">
    This project is displayed on a web frontend (HTML/JS/CSS) hosted on a local server and controlled using the Django Framework running on
    Python. All of our data is stored in a local PostgreSQL database, which is similarly controlled using the Django Framework.
